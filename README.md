# About uniGasFoam
The uniGasFoam solver is an open-source particle-based simulation framework for multiscale rarefied gas flows. It is entirely designed in OpenFOAM and is an extension of the well-established direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver dsmcFoam+. The uniGasFoam code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 which can be found in *doc/LICENCE.md*.

# Installation and Usage
Detailed instructions for installing and building uniGasFoam can be found in *doc/INSTALL.md*. Using uniGasFoam will be relatively straightforward for users who are already familiar with the OpenFOAM suite. A detailed description of case file structure and dictionary entries is provided in *doc/GUIDE.md*. as a guide to the uniGasFoam solver. 

The source files for the libraries are located in *src/lagrangian* and the executable file for running the solver can be found in *application/solvers/discreteMethods/uniGasFoam*. In addition, tutorial cases can be found in the *tutorials/uniGasFoam* directory.
